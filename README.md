# <a name='howitworks'>How it works</a> 

Basicaly it is a website to track sport (running, cycling, swimming and hiking) activities. What makes it different from other options is the advantage of accessing to source code (see [License](#license) for more details) by anyone. Usage is absolutely free of charge.

In addition any user can at anytime export all his/her information (tracks, metadata) from the system. Tracks are exported as GPX files and database metadata as JSON.

Activities can be uploaded in three ways:

* Entering data manually using a form.
* Uploading file.
* Using [Garmin Connect plugin](http://developer.garmin.com/web-device/garmin-communicator-plugin/).

Supported source data formats:

* [GPX v1.x](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) ([schema](http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/))
  * [GPX+](https://www.cluetrust.com/Schemas/gpxdata10.xsd) To support additional data like heartrate, cadence, laps, etc.
* [TCX v2](http://developer.garmin.com/schemas/tcx/v2/)
* [FIT](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FIT)
